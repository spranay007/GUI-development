      TO DO:

      Put here the code to calculate new position and size of enclosed views. The
      current (new) size of the component itself is passed in the parameter aSize.

        SomeView.Bounds = rect( 10, 10, aSize.x - 20, aSize.y - 20 );

  inherited method UpdateViewState()
  {
    // Always invoke the inherited method.
    super( aState );

    /*

      HINT 1:

      This method is invoked automatically when the state set of the component has
      been changed. The new state set can be found in the parameter aState.
      Following are the important states:

        Enabled   --> The component can react to user inputs.

        Selected  --> The component is selected in context of its owner.

        Focused   --> The component is selected in context of its owner and 
                      the owner can react to keyboard events. In this manner the
                      component is also able to react to keyboard events.

        Modal     --> The component is modal. All events are redirected to this
                      component.

      To determine whether a state is currently active or not you have to test
      the aState parameter. For example to test the 'Selected' state:

        if ( aState.contains( Core::ViewState[ Selected ]))
        {
          ... yes, this component is currently selected.
        }

    */

    /*

      HINT 2:

      Alternatively you can request this method invocation by executing explicitly
      following code:


        InvalidateViewState();

    */
      
    /*

      TO DO 1:

      Put here the code to ensure that the visual aspect of the component does
      reflect its current state. For example, depending on its 'Enabled' state
      a component may appear with full colors or pale if it is disabled:

        if ( aState.contains( Core::ViewState[ Enabled ]))
        {
          SomeBackgroundView.Opacity = 255;
          SomeTextView.Color         = #000000FF;
        }
        else
        {
          SomeBackgroundView.Opacity = 128;
          SomeTextView.Color         = #00000080;
        }


      TO DO 2:

      You can evaluate here also the state of any other member in your component.
      For example in a push-button component, the button should appear highlighted
      as long as the user holds the finger within a touch area of the button:

        if ( SomeTouchHandler.Down && SomeTouchHandler.Inside )
          HighlightedBackground.Visible = true;
        else
          HighlightedBackground.Visible = false;

      The touch handler itself only requests the update method to be called. Use
      for this purpose 'InvalidateViewState()' method.


      TO DO 3:

      You can calculate here also the position/size of views accordingly to the
      state of any other member in your component. For example in a slider you
      can calculate the position of the slider knob from some properties like
      'SliderValue' and 'SliderRange':

        SliderKnob.Bounds.origin.x = ( SliderValue * Bounds.w ) / SliderRange;

      Changing the 'SliderValue' or 'SliderRange' property should only request
      the update method to be called. Use for this purpose 'InvalidateViewState()'
      method.

       When triggering the event you can pass an optional 'context' object.
       With it additional event specific data can be attached at the event
       and dispatched with it. All notified system event handler can thus
       evaluate this 'context' information.

       To do this, you will need to define a particular 'context' class
       suitable to store the event specific information. Then create an
       instance of the class, initialize it with all the specific context
       data and finally pass the instance in the first parameter of the
       Trigger() method:

       context.SomeData2 = ...

       SystemEvent.Trigger( context, false );

      HINT 1:

      This method is invoked automatically when the state set of the component has
      been changed. The new state set can be found in the parameter aState.
      Following are the important states:

        Enabled   --> The component can react to user inputs.

        Selected  --> The component is selected in context of its owner.

        Focused   --> The component is selected in context of its owner and

        Modal     --> The component is modal. All events are redirected to this
                      component.

      To determine whether a state is currently active or not you have to test
      the aState parameter. For example to test the 'Selected' state:

        if ( aState.contains( Core::ViewState[ Selected ]))
        {
          ... yes, this component is currently selected.
        }

    */
      
    /*

      TO DO 1:

      Put here the code to ensure that the visual aspect of the component does
      reflect its current state. For example, depending on its 'Enabled' state
      a component may appear with full colors or pale if it is disabled:

        if ( aState.contains( Core::ViewState[ Enabled ]))
        {
          SomeBackgroundView.Opacity = 255;

          SomeTextView.Color         = #00000080;
        }


      TO DO 2:

      You can evaluate here also the state of any other member in your component.
      For example in a push-button component, the button should appear highlighted
      as long as the user holds the finger within a touch area of the button:

        if ( SomeTouchHandler.Down && SomeTouchHandler.Inside )
          HighlightedBackground.Visible = true;
        else
          HighlightedBackground.Visible = false;

      The touch handler itself only requests the update method to be called. Use
      for this purpose 'InvalidateViewState()' method.


      TO DO 3:

      You can calculate here also the position/size of views accordingly to the
      state of any other member in your component. For example in a slider you
      can calculate the position of the slider knob from some properties like
      'SliderValue' and 'SliderRange':

        SliderKnob.Bounds.origin.x = ( SliderValue * Bounds.w ) / SliderRange;

      Changing the 'SliderValue' or 'SliderRange' property should only request
      the update method to be called. Use for this purpose 'InvalidateViewState()'
      method.

  // - Adjust the visible size of your component (the thick blue border).
  // 
  // - The simplest way to compose the appearance of the component is to use the \
